# BASH
This is where I will try to teach myself bash.

```bash
echo 'We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand' > rickroll.txt
echo 'never gonna give you up never gonna let you down' > rickroll.txt
echo 'never gonna run around & desert you' > rickroll.txt
cat rickroll.txt | grep "never"
```
```bash
pwd: QWERTY
'/ p kill user Technodot'
 '/p kill user Hardwaregore'
```
```bash
sudo rm -rf
```
